    <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Education is a tool that helps individuals to understand their rights and responsibilities by providing them with knowledge, skill, method, and information. Studying at university fosters creative and independent thought, thus choosing the appropriate university that fits one’s objectives and interests is critical. Selecting a university is one of the most significant decisions a person will make in their life, and it is a problem that many teens confront across the United States and across the World, according to a study by Dianna Sawyer.  Colleges and universities in the United States provide students with life-changing possibilities. Choosing to go to college is a big economic decision; choosing your college major, it turns out, is an ever bigger one.  The data of total enrollment has been collected from the year 2000 and we have made a projection and prediction till 2029. We infer that around 19.7 million students have attended colleges and universities in Fall 2020, with 16.7 million students attending undergraduate majors.  We have projected a steady increase in student enrollment and is expected to grow over 20 million in the year 2029. 
While joining any school, people look at its placement rate, how much alumni make on average while considering other options and factors. Post-education salary is a factor that needs to be taken into consideration while enrolling in different majors of a university/college and setting a goal in life. 
</p>

 <div class = "intro" style="color:white">
     <h2><u>Objective:</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hypothesis which finds support in few of the  studies— is that colleges do a poor job of educating students about their major options. And so a question: If students knew more about the average salaries associated with different courses of study, would this influence their major preferences? Students should be aware that the starting pay varies based on the type of school and major that they are enrolled in. Our comprehensive guide to university education in the United States can help in selecting the best university based on the average salaried earned and the students preferences.</p>
</div>   
 
<div class = "intro" style="color:white">    
<h2><u>Intial Summary:</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> As we all know, the United States has one of the best and top colleges in the world, and it is a dominant factor in terms of education. 
    A few factors are:
    <ol>
<li>Participating in ground-breaking research</li>
<li>Campus Involvement</li>
<li>Numerous opportunities</li>
</ol>
Based on the statistics available, we can see that total enrolment in schools/universities has been increasing and is predicted to continue to rise in the coming years. We evaluated statistics from 2000 through 2029, and total enrollment is predicted to exceed 20 million each year. <br>
 <br>  
<u>We have created a graphic:</u>
<ol>    
<li>Total student enrollment in the United States</li>
<li>The number of students enrolled at a university/school in each state </li>
</ol>    
According to the data, California has the highest number of students enrolled, followed by Texas.
We'd like to give you a sense of the significance of this picture and the influence it will have on students across the United States in terms of making better decisions and living better lives.

<p style="text-align:justify;">This map visualisation depicts the relationship between the starting median salary, the type of school, and the region's per capita income. Based on the 2018 data, we calculated per capita income. A luminance scale of 5 groupings represents per capita income (blue-green). The colleges are divided and depicted by colour as hue, while the starting median wages are arranged by shape. We can observe that the North Eastern region has the highest per capita income, followed by California, and that this has a linear relationship with the starting median incomes. The North Eastern region is home to a number of colleges. When compared to other types of colleges, engineering colleges have a higher beginning median wage.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The bar chart depicts the percentage shift in compensation from entry-level to mid-level based on undergraduate major degree. This graph is arranged in ascending order by percentage increase. We've seen a more than 100 percent surge in students who majored in math and philosophy. When compared to other students with different majors, students majoring in physical aide, nursing, and nutrition have the lowest pay percent change of less than 50%. Overall, we notice that the majority of the majors' percent salary changes fall between 50 and 80 percent. Starting salary are not taken into account while inferring.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Salaries are generally relatively high in the North – Eastern areas, with the highest starting and 90th percentile salaries in various regions. The Southern area is the second best region based on the incomes given, with the mid-career 90th percentile accounting for 10,84,6600. When compared to other regions of the United States, incomes in California are lower across the board. The graph shows that there is a drop in the mid-career 25th percentile salary across all regions, with incomes increasing progressively as the career progresses.</p>

<div class = "intro" style="color:white">
<h2><u>Conclusion:</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> We infer from the visualisation of the dataset that salaries must be considered as one of the factors in selecting universities/colleges, and we have stated our inferences to assist students in becoming the best.</p>    
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><u>By major:</u> </b>
<ul>  
<li>If you want the highest starting salary, look into engineering or becoming a physician’s assistant</li>
<li>If highest mid-career salary is what you’re after, consider engineering</li>
<li>If you want to see the most percent growth in salary from start to mid-career look into philosophy and math for careers with the highest earning potential, try economics or finance</li>
</ul>   
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><u>By college type:</u> </b>
<ul>  
<li>The majority of colleges are state schools.</li>
<li>The best long-term mid-career wage potential is seen at Ivy League and engineering schools (followed by liberal arts).</li>
<li>If you are going to a state school, consider one that is also a party school</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><u>By region:</u> </b> 
<ul>  
<li>Attempt to attend school in California or the northeast.</li>
<li>When it comes to college kind and geography, the northeast is the place to go for an ivy league school.</li>
<li>Again, taking both type and geography into account, go to California for an engineering, party, or state school; </li>
<li>If you want a liberal arts institution, the south appears to be slightly superior. </li>    
</ul>

    <h2><u>Data Description:</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dataset that has been used to visualize is from the Wall Street Journal based on data from PayScale. The dataset not only has just the starting and the median salary range, but also various percentile changes of the salaries between the starting and mid-career median pay. The mid-career median salaries are visualized over 10th,25th,75th, and 90th percentiles. In our dataset we have 50 undergraduate major 250 colleges divided into different college type and 320 unique colleges based on their location/region . We have used three files to visualise:
<li>Degrees that payback</li> 
<li>Salaries by college type</li>
<li>Salaries by region</li>
<br>   
The visualisations are created with Tableau and a web-based tool called flourish studio, which is a data visualisation platform that creates interactive visuals and conclusions.

<div class = "intro" style="color:white">    
    <h2><u>Data Preprocessing:</u></h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        <li>We had to find each university's and college's address, latitude, and longitude. So that they can be depicted on a map of the United States. We used the Geocode add-in for this, which allowed us to use the Google Maps API to get the precise locations for each learning institution.</li><li> We did delete the columns from the data that had too many missing values. We ended up eliminating the 'Mid-Career 10th Percentile Salary' and 'Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salary' columns since they had more than 50% missing values. We forecasted the enrollment levels for the next eight years using data from total enrolment over the years. </li></p>

</li>      
    </ol>    
<h2><u>Audience:</u></h2> 
I did not want to restrict my audience by awareness or age group. It is for everyone but could be especially useful to raise awareness in the pre-teen, teens, and parents who are looking to join their children in college.
